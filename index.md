### About Me

![me](assets/square.jpeg)

I am a Full Stack Engineer with experience using PostgreSQL, Java, Javascript, Angular, Python, and C++. I enjoy making software tools to help people to solve problems.

When I am not programming, I enjoy playing video games, practicing typing, listening to and playing music, going on walks outside, and spending time with my friends.
